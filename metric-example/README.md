# Metrics Examples
Dynatrace supports complex query functionality for metrics data through its _metric selector_ language.

Once you learn the ropes, you can apply that to multiple areas of the product, such as:
* Metric REST API,
* Data Explorer,
* Custom Events for Alerting,
* SLOs.

## Getting Started
If you are just getting started with metric selectors and you learn best by example, then
[Query by Example](query-by-example.md) is a good place for you to start. If you already
feel comfortable with simple metric selectors and are looking for examples of more advanced
features of metric selectors, then you may want to check out
[Metric Expressions by Example](metric-expressions-by-example.md) as well.

## Reference
Even example-oriented people need to look up something in the reference once in a while.

For that, please refer to the metric selector documentation on
[dynatrace.com](https://www.dynatrace.com/support/help/dynatrace-api/environment-api/metric-v2/metric-selector/).
